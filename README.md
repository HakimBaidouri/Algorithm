# Sorting and Searching Algorithms

## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of various **sorting** and **searching** algorithms. Throughout my exploration of algorithmic optimization, I have developed a deep interest in understanding how different techniques improve efficiency. Studying these algorithms has allowed me to grasp key concepts such as **time complexity**, **space complexity**, and **optimization strategies**.

## Why This Project?

Optimizing code is not just about making it run faster; it's about understanding the trade-offs between different approaches. By working on sorting and searching algorithms, I have learned:

- How **divide and conquer** strategies work (e.g., Quick Sort).
- The importance of **choosing the right algorithm** depending on the data structure and constraints.
- How different algorithms handle **worst-case and average-case scenarios**.
- The role of **in-place vs. out-of-place sorting** and their effect on memory usage.
- How some **built-in JavaScript functions** like `.push()` and `.pop()` are efficient (O(1)), while others like `.shift()` increase complexity (O(n)).

## Implemented Algorithms

### **Sorting Algorithms**

- **Bubble Sort** – Simple but inefficient sorting algorithm.
- **Quick Sort** – Efficient, divide-and-conquer sorting with O(n log n) complexity.

### **Searching Algorithms**

- **Linear Search** – A simple O(n) search for unsorted arrays.
- **Binary Search** – A fast O(log n) search for sorted arrays.
- **Two Crystal Balls Problem** – A real-world optimization using the square root approach.

## Lessons Learned

- **Understanding Time Complexity**: Learning how different algorithms scale with large inputs.
- **Choosing the Right Algorithm**: Recognizing when a stable sort is necessary versus an in-place one.
- **Algorithmic Optimization**: Reducing unnecessary comparisons and swaps to improve performance.

## Code Challenges & Practice

I have also practiced my problem-solving skills by completing challenges on **CodeWars**.
