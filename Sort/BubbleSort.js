/**
 * Bubble Sort Algorithm
 * 
 * Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, 
 * compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) in the worst and average cases, O(n) in the best case (already sorted input).
 * Space Complexity: O(1) as sorting happens in place.
